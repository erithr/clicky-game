# clicky-game

### Project Overview
This project was an assignment in the Northwestern Full Stack Coding Program. The ojective of this assignment was to create an interactive React Game in this case a memory game.   

### Issues or other things to add
So getting the objects on the page was not that difficult as we had several examples that I could reference, the most difficult this was wrapping my head arond how to inract with each component. To get some practice in i made every element on the page an compopnent so that I could better understand how each of them acts like a block that I can plug into the page. I also quite enjoyed being able to create a css file for each component which was really good for me to isolate styles and visial elements. Currently the game does not have a win condition, once you guess all 12 correctly the game acts like you can get another correct guess but since there are only 12 options you click and lose and start over. I need to add a win condition that resets the game once you get a score of 12. 

## Getting Started
The game is ready to play at the start. There are 12 different characters loaded on the page once you click on one all of them will shuffle and the game will remember which character was selected. Your score will then increase for each different character selected. Once a duplicate character is selected the app will reset and the game will start over, but your high score will remaind so that you can see how well you did.
